        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  </p>
        <p>It is a small and lightweight language.</p>
        <p>Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
        <p>Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. </li>
          <li>Increase front-end interaction</li>
          <li>Enables high functionality in front-end</li>
          <li>Better Presentation of the websites</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <header>WEB DESIGN</header>
        <p>Web design can be divided into front-end or back-end.</p>
        <p>The Front-end part mainly involves how the websites appear and  how it is interpreted by the web browsers.
        </p>
        <p>The back-end mainly involves how data supplied by users can be stored into a database system and how these data can also be retrieved to provide details to users.</p>
        <p>For front-end, web developers  achieve this by using the following languages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
        </ul>
                <p>HTML - also known as hyper text markup language uses tags which are used for editing the content of the webpages.An example is provided below:</p>
               
                <code> the p <\p><\p> tag  which is used to represent a paragraph</code>
                <p>There are other elements which can be used for more information click the link below. <a href="#" target="_blank">More Information</a></p>
        <p>CSS -  also known as Cascading Style Sheet is used to edit how the html elements appear on the webpage. An example is provided below: </p>
        <code>
          p{backgroud-color:red}
        </code>
        <p>the statement above is used to set the background-color of the paragraph to red</p>
        <p>There are 3 types using Cascading Styles which are :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline css</li>
          <li>External css</li>
          <li>Header style css</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For each of these cases, each is different. An example will be shown below</p>
        <p>To use external css use the following syntax</p>
        <code> <\link rel="stylesheet" href="file_name"></code>
        <p>For inline css use the following syntax</p>
        <code><\p styles="background-color:red;"><\p></code>
        <p>To use header style css use the style tags between the head elements of a webpage. The syntax is provided below</p>
        <code> <\head>stye{
          p:
            color:red;
        }<\/head></code>
        <p>Web design also uses javascript which is used to add functionality to webpages and provide better user interaction.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="back-end">
        <header>Back-end Development</header>
        <p>The back-end development of the website is used to capture user data and store the data.</p>
        <p>It can also be used for data retrieving data from the database to provide information to users.</p>
        <p>Back-end development mainly involves using the following languages : </p>
        <ul>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>PHP - PHP stand for Procedural Hyper Progammiging language which is used to add functionality to the webpage</p>
        <p>An example of php code is provided below</p>
        <code>
          $root = ["$local_host"]
          $username = ["user"]
        </code>
        <p>The above code shows how variable are declared in php. They contain the dollar sign ($).</p>
        <p>SQL - stand for Structured Query Language which is used to fetch and transmit data the data base</p>
        <p>The code below will be used to show an example of SQL Language and give a brief and precise description</p>
        <code> sql_query = *INSERT * values("name","id")</code>
        <p>Javascript -  The Server-side of javaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.

        <header>Object Oriented Programming</header>
                <p>Object Oriented Programming Language is a programming language that uses objects to design and develop programms and application</p>
        <p>Each object consist of its own data and has it's own function which can manipulate the data</p>
        <p>Examples of Object Oriented Programming Language include : </p>
        <ul>
          <li>C++</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a programming language to be considered as an Object Programming Language, it should meet the following : </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Support inheritance</li>
          <li>Support polymorphism</li>
          <li>Support Data Encapsulation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To show a simple example C++ program</p>
        <code>
          #include <\iostream>
          using namespace std;
          int main()
          {
            cout<<"Hello World"
          }
        </code>
        <p><i><b>#include <\iostream></b></i> - these are preprocessor directives that tell the compiler to include the input output standard library which is used  for input and output functions.</p>
